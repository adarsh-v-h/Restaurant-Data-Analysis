# 🍽️ Cognifyz Machine Learning Internship – Restaurant Data Analysis

## 📍 Project Overview
This project analyzes restaurant data from multiple countries to uncover insights about:
- Cuisines
- City patterns
- Ratings
- Costs
- Customer votes
- Delivery & table booking patterns

The goal is to clean the dataset, understand patterns, build ML models, and finally present insights in a simple way that both technical and non-technical people can understand.
